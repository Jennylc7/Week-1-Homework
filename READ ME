1.  I checked the source code to see if it was readable.
2.  I checked the HTML elements and made sure the structure was readable.
3.  I added alt attributes to the images.
4.  I fixed the broken "Search Engine Optimization" link.
5.  I added comments to both the HTML and CSS files.
6.  I renamed the title to be in line with the company message.
7.  I changed the HTML elements that were labled "Class" elements in the CSS code, so that thay would reflect HTML code.  The Class labeling was unneccessary.
